                                 The EPMM is a unit commitment and economic dispatch model, which during the
                                  optimization process satisfies the electricity consumption needs in the modelled
                                  countries at minimum system cost considering the different types of costs and capacity
                                  constraints of the available power plants and cross-border transmission capacities.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The model minimizes the production cost of power plants to satisfy demand. These costs
                                  include start-up and shut-down costs of the power plants, the costs of production
                                  (mainly fuel and CO2 costs) and the costs which occur in case of curtailment of RES
                                  producers.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The model simultaneously optimizes all 168 hours of a modelled week, and as a result it
                                  determines the hours of the week in which power plants will operate and at what
                                  production level. The model is executed for all weeks of the given year, hence all
                                  8760 hours are modelled. To increase the robustness of the model results, the model
                                  starts the weekly optimisation with Wednesdays and finishes with Tuesdays, to avoid
                                  that the fastest ramp-up period (Monday morning) would be the starting position of
                                  the optimisation. EPMM endogenously models 41 electricity markets in 38 countries.l

                              <p>Power plants are represented at the unit/block level for each country and are divided
                                  into twelve technologies: biomass, hard-coal and lignite-based, geothermal, heavy fuel
                                  oil and light fuel oil, hydro, wind, PV, nuclear, natural gas and tide and wave power
                                  plants. </p>
                              <p>All generation units are characterised by the following inputs: installed capacity,
                                  electrical efficiency and self-consumption. Short-run marginal costs of generation are
                                  calculated based on the country and technology specific fuel price, variable
                                  operational costs, taxes and CO2 emission costs. In case of dispatchable units
                                  (thermal, nuclear, storage hydropower and pumped storage) start-up costs are included.
                                  Renewable generation, other than biomass and storage hydropower, is included
                                  exogenously assuming zero marginal cost. Generation patterns are based on European
                                  weather data from 2006-2011 for PV and wind generation and 2008-2017 for hydro. These
                                  renewable technologies are non-dispatchable but can be curtailed at given costs. </p>
                              <p>Hydro generation is classified into three categories: run of river, pumped storage and
                                  reservoir. The reservoir hydro units can flexibly produce electricity while facing a
                                  maximum production constraint in aggregate for the entire week. This allows the model
                                  to capture the flexibility of hydro generation while placing a realistic limit to its
                                  overall contribution to the weekly and yearly electricity generation.</p>
                              <p><b>Demand side representation in the model</b></p>
                              <p>The power demand is an exogenous input to the hourly optimisation of the power system.
                                  Hourly demand data is derived from actual data of the year 2015, which is adjusted in
                                  the scenarios proportionally by assumed growth of the yearly consumption by 2030. The
                                  power demand is then met by the available power plant and import capacities subject to
                                  minimisation of the cost to serve demand.</p>
                              <p><b>Transmission grid representation </b></p>
                              <p>In the EPMM model each country represents one node, thus network constraints inside the
                                  countries are not considered. Cross-border transmission capacities are represented by
                                  net transfer capacities (NTCs) values, which put an upper limit to cross-border
                                  electricity trading. Exports and imports of power in a given hour may thus not exceed
                                  the NTC values. Imports and exports take place to minimise system cost and maximise
                                  security of supply.</p>
