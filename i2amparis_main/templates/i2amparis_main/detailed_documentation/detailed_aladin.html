                                ALADIN is an agent-based simulation model for assessing the market diffusion of
                                alternative fuel vehicles (AFV). The acronym ALADIN stands for ALternative Automobiles
                                Diffusion and INfrastructure. To date, the simulation comprises the market diffusion of
                                passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles in Germany and Europe until 2050. The simulation
                                is
                                based on driving data of several thousand individual vehicles that are treated as agents
                                purchasing new vehicles. Changes in prices, user preferences, and model availability
                                lead
                                to market evolution for fuels and vehicles in road transport.

                                comparison of the economic efficiency of different drive systems and considering
                                obstructive and supportive factors for approximately 6,500 driving profiles. The
                                successive approach allows the effects of individual influencing factors on market
                                evolution to be analysed separately and thus makes it more transparent.

                                The costs of buying and using a vehicle of course play an important role for potential
                                buyers when making a purchasing decision. In commercial fleets, the economic aspects
                                are even more important. Compared to conventional cars, AFV are generally more
                                expensive to purchase, but they are often cheaper to run because of lower fuel and
                                maintenance costs, among other things. It is therefore essential to look at costs in
                                terms of the total use, in order to determine for which utilisation or driving
                                profiles electric cars are more economical than conventional ones. Total cost
                                calculations for vehicles are correspondingly a common component of models of market
                                penetration of electric vehicles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The model consists of three basic steps (see the figure below). In a first step, the costs of
                                total use, referred to as TCO (Total Cost of Ownership), are ascertained for
                                alternative and conventional vehicles. The TCO comprise the purchase and operating
                                costs for the respective vehicle and are calculated from a user’s perspective. Three
                                user groups are distinguished—private, commercial (only fleet vehicles) and company
                                cars—because of their different rates of taxation and depreciation options as well as
                                their deviating patterns of utilisation. Because the TCO are also strongly influenced
                                by the size of the vehicle, different car segments are also distinguished.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The drive technologies analysed included battery electric vehicles (BEV), plug-in
                                electric vehicles (PEV), range-extended vehicles (REEV), plug-in hybrids (PHEV), CNG
                                vehicles and fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEV) as well as conventional gasoline and
                                diesel vehicles. For the TCO calculations, the cheapest respective drive technology is
                                selected.

                                One of the key innovations of ALADIN compared to previous TCO analyses is that the
                                calculations are not made based on average annual mileages but are instead based on
                                real-life driving profiles. A driving profile covers all the trips including the
                                purpose, length of route, departure and arrival time, duration as well as information
                                about the vehicle over an observation period of at least one week. Profiles vary
                                widely by user even within the different groups and have a very strong influence on
                                the economic efficiency of electric vehicles. The barrier presented by BEV’s limited
                                range is explicitly considered in the analyses; each individual driving profile is
                                analysed according to whether the driver is able to make all the trips with a BEV. In
                                addition, the electric driving share of PHEV or REEV is simulated individually for
                                each driving profile. This is important to obtain realistic results on economic
                                efficiency, which depends on the share of electric driving and is especially relevant
                                for PHEV and REEV. The first step, therefore, is to make TCO calculations on this
                                basis.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the second step, the TCO calculations are extended by including the costs of the
                                main charging infrastructure. This is done in order to put the assessment of the
                                economic efficiency in the TCO calculations on a broader basis. Charging
                                infrastructure costs vary widely depending on the charging type and location. For
                                instance, using private charging infrastructure is generally cheaper for drivers with
                                a garage than for drivers using public charging infrastructure, on which on-street
                                parkers have to rely. Because the methodology is a simulation which does not represent
                                spatial modelling but only trip purposes (such as for example “going home”, “going to
                                work”, “going shopping”), statements about the infrastructure are only possible to a
                                limited extent. The infrastructure assumption made is the same for all users in the
                                respective user group. Depending on the scenario, car users are provided with a
                                different amount of charging infrastructure (for example, only charging at home for
                                private users and only charging at work for commercial users). In terms of costs,
                                however, only the primary charging point (e.g. the private wall box of garage owners)
                                is classified.

                                The brand and size of a vehicle are also important factors influencing the decision to
                                buy. For instance, many buyers are extremely loyal to a particular brand. There will
                                continue to be a restricted range of models and brands of electric vehicles available
                                in the near future, which represents a limiting factor for the market evolution of
                                electric vehicles. The restricted choice and availability of brands are therefore
                                taken into account in the model. This is done by analysing currently offered models of
                                electric vehicles and the announcements made about planned new ones. Logistic growth
                                in the number of available makes with BEV or REEV/PHEV drives is then determined on
                                this basis using ordinary least squares regression. It is also assumed that some
                                buyers decide in favour of an EV of a different brand (if an EV has ideal TCO) and the
                                rest for a conventional vehicle of the original brand. The most important factors
                                obstructing market diffusion of electric vehicles are taken into account with the
                                economic efficiency, range anxiety and limited offer of electric vehicles.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The fourth and final step then integrates other aspects of electric vehicles, which
                                tend to support their market penetration, for example environmental friendliness, low
                                noise emissions or the allure of an innovative technology. These supportive aspects
                                are integrated in the model for private users via the willingness to pay more.
                                Experience shows that the admission of a willingness to pay a higher price in
                                questionnaires is not the same as actually observed purchasing behaviour.
                                Nevertheless, it does provide first indications of the esteem attached to new
                                technologies and the approximate magnitude of the willingness to pay more for them.
                                The approach of taking the willingness to pay a higher price is a common one in market
                                diffusion models of AFVs.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In this final step, the market evolution is modelled for AFV in Germany up to 2050.
                                The driving profiles at which an AFV becomes economically viable are determined for
                                each year based on the analyses conducted. The evolution of the market is then
                                determined by extrapolating the share of these users in newly registered vehicles.
                                Monetary policy measures are also integrated into the model such as purchase bonuses,
                                for example, and their impacts on the evolution of the market are quantified.

                                The market diffusion of passenger cars in Europe is based on the projected diffusion
                                in Germany and combined with country specific factors. We fit logistic functions to
                                model-based predictions for Germany, for the period 2017-2030 and transfer them to
                                the other European countries with modifications according to the national electricity
                                and gasoline price ratio. The basic rationale is to use current market shares as
                                starting point and modify the logistic market diffusion according to national
                                conditions. These conditions, when expressed in savings per kilometre between
                                conventional and PEVs, vary between €0.03 and €0.08 per km (between countries that
                                combine less electricity prices with high gasoline prices or vice versa). These
                                country specific fuel savings are used to set the growth parameter of a logistic
                                diffusion curve. The second parameter of the diffusion curve, the time with 50% market
                                diffusion, is set such that the logistic market diffusion curve meets the countries
                                2016 PEV sales share. We thus arrive at country specific logistic market diffusion
                                curves of PEV that are projected until 2050.

                            <p>
                                We calculate sales and stock for AFV heavy duty vehicles until 2030 for Germany and
                                extrapolate market shares until 2050. The reason for the extrapolation is that the
                                extrapolation of market shares provides higher certainty than extrapolating the
                                forecasts for individual parameters in long-term forecasts. The calculated market
                                shares are considered equal in all other European countries as we assume a coordinated
                                European infrastructure ramp up and heavy road transport is to a large extent
                                trans-national in Europe. For catenary hybrid trucks, the share of electric driving
                                with trolley trucks depends on the share of highways with overhead lines and the
                                annual driving distance of the truck (the average share of km on the highway increases
                                with annual vehicle km travelled). We assume that connected highway segments with the
                                highest heavy-duty traffic will be electrified first. In many cases, the distribution
                                of highway traffic is right skewed. Accordingly, the relation between the share of
                                electrified vehicle kilometres and electrified highway kilometres is modelled
                                mathematically.

                                The driving profiles of vehicles form a very important foundation for the
                                calculations. A separate database (“REM2030-Fahrprofile”) is used for commercial
                                traffic (fleet users) and the so called “Mobility Panel” for private and company car
                                users (MOP), which also contains information about the driver that can be used to
                                distinguish private users with privately owned vehicles from those with a company car.
                                The driving data only covers Germany, but general driving patterns do not vary much
                                within Europe, only the total distance travelled (in million passenger km or average
                                annual of vehicle kilometres travelled). The influence of the charging infrastructure
                                can also be modelled to a certain extent using the driving profiles, because the
                                driving profiles of the mobility panel contain information about the trips made.
                                As already discussed, no spatially resolved modelling is done. A willingness to pay
                                more is assigned to each individual private driving profile according to the
                                affiliation to one of four groups in the innovation process. Based on a
                                cross-comparison of the different studies, it is assumed that 55% of commercial users
                                are not willing to pay more. The other 45% have a willingness to pay 10% more on the
                                so-called Full Leasing Rate. In the market evolution model, this is translated as an
                                extra 7% on top of the purchase price of the conventional reference model. Overall,
                                the assumptions about the willingness to pay more are rather cautious compared to the
                                statements made in the underlying studies. As already stated, company car users are
                                assumed not willing to pay more. In ALADIN, only 1.5% of the driving profiles are
                                assigned a willingness to pay of more than 10%, and approximately half of the private

                                more is assumed to decrease to 60% by 2020 and further thereafter for both private and
                                commercial users, because novel technologies become less attractive over time.

                                The ALADIN model covers Germany and Europe (individual EU28 countries as well as
                                Switzerland and Norway). It simulates the market diffusion of AFVs from 2011 until 2050.
                                Focus of the analysis are passenger cars, as well as light-duty, medium-duty and
                                heavy-duty vehicles. Additional model runs cover the US, China, and India.

                                The model covers the PEV, BEV, PHEV, REEV, CNG, and FCEV as mitigation options in road
                                transport for passenger cars. The model can incorporate the change in energy, vehicle,
                                or battery prices directly. Changes in general car usage or purchase, such as the
                                increased usage of car sharing, must be integrated as changes in total passenger car
                                sales. Furthermore, modal shifts can be integrated indirectly too, e.g. as reduction in
                                annual mileage of the vehicles or lower total number of vehicles sold. One strength of
                                the model is that an increased availability of public charging infrastructure can be
                                directly modelled.

                                catenary hybrid trucks as mitigation technologies. An increase in charging or
                                refuelling infrastructure can be directly modelled in ALADIN, whereas a total change in
                                freight activity must be incorporated as reduced vehicles sales or change in annual
                                mileage.

                                            Germany. It develops a model for the optimal siting and number of the
                                            refueling network with capacity limits as important property of hydrogen
                                            fuel stations. We find about 160 – 350 Hydrogen refeuling stations to
                                            cover heavy-duty highway transport in Germany. A capacity limit per
                                            station increases the number of stations required and changes their
                                            optimal location.
