                              The World Trade Model with Bilateral Trades (WTMBT in the following) is a meso-economic
                                  linear optimization model based on the comparative advantage principle. Considering m
                                  world regions with n industries each, the WTMBT enables to endogenously determine the
                                  production yields and trades patterns required to satisfy an exogenously specified
                                  final demand yield in each region, minimizing the use of factors of production (labor
                                  and capital) by complying with regional factors endowments (e.g. availability of
                                  natural resources, land, workforce, etc.). The choice of developing a model which
                                  includes the cost of bilateral trades (i.e. WTMBT), is driven by the relevance of
                                  transport in determining the arrangement of production and trades and by its
                                  non-negligible impact on carbon emissions. The economic and environmental implications
                                  of national and international transport of products are included in the model and
                                  weighed depending on transport distances. With respect to General Equilibrium Models
                                  (CGE), the WTMBT requires less exogenous data since it considers households and
                                  government final demand as constant and perfectly rigid with respect to endogenous
                                  change in prices of goods and services. Therefore, instead of maximizing social
                                  utility, the WTMBT establishes that the highest-cost producers set the products
                                  prices, and each region chooses to produce or to import by minimizing the overall
                                  costs complying with their own production factors availability (i.e. factor
                                  endowments). In the WTMBT, production technologies, factors use coefficients and final
                                  demand for each country are derived from Multi-Regional Input-Output tables (MRIO).
                                  Other exogenous inputs like factor endowments, weights of transported goods and
                                  regional distances are derived from other databases (e.g. World Bank, International
                                  Energy Agency), depending on the scope of the adopted MRIO and on the type of analysis
                                  to be carried out.

                              <p>The model is asked to provide the minimization of factor cost of economic activities
                                  while meeting, for every economy, the final demand of consumers, the intermediate
                                  demand of industries and export demand (with its demand of transport services) of each
                                  sector by means of production or import.

                                  capital and labour) and the emission of CO2 and other polluters.</p>
                              <p>In this formulation of the model, the electricity sector generates an output which can
                                  be produced by several different technologies: the model will chose between the
                                  alternatives on the basis of the solely principle of comparative advantage, which
                                  regulates all the model decisions.</p>

                                The model considers CO2 emissions as a direct consequence of the endogenous production
                                  of the sectors and regions considered in the model. These emissions are expressed
                                  with respect to the sector, region and type of pollutant or greenhouse gas. Thanks to

                                  for assigning responsibility for emissions (e.g. Production-Based Approach,
                                  Consumption-Based Approach).

                                  The socio-economic dimension is considered in the objective function of the model,
                                  which foresees a minimisation of the global use of productive factors net of scarcity
                                  rents that may emerge when one or more resources become scarce. In fact, these
                                  resources are bound not to exceed a maximum level of availability, called factor
                                  endowments (e.g. maximum number of high-skilled workers for a given sector in a given
                                  region).

                                  The existing technology is determined by the multiregional input-output database
                                  adopted as input to the optimization model. Sectoral interrelationships,
                                  characterizing the technology mix of each region, are exogenously determined.
                                  An exception is made for the electricity sector where it is possible to choose between
                                  several technologies to meet the needs of both industries and households for
                                  electricity. Also in this choice, the model is guided by the principle of comparative
                                  advantage that will produce the least expensive technology until one or more resources
                                  are exhausted.In this sense, mitigation and adaptation scenarios can be simulated by
                                  introducing additional constraints (which model the introduction of a policy) that
                                  disrupt either the cost of a technology, the availability of one or more resources or
                                  other types of constraints (e.g. impose exogenously a new final demand).

                                  The model minimizes the global cost, in terms of the use of productive factors, like
                                  labour and capital, of satisfying an exogenously determined quantity of goods and
                                  services. The primary formulation of this linear model provides for the satisfaction
                                  of the final demand for each region, taking into account the resulting need for
                                  intermediate demand due to the sectoral interrelationships of each region, the
                                  possibility to import from another region, the possibility to export one's own product
                                  net of transport costs and resource limits. This formulation is underpinned by a dual
                                  formulation of the same problem that provides for a maximization of final demand net
                                  of scarcity rents that may emerge when the limits of a resource are reached. Price
                                  indices will take into account transport costs and relative price differences that may
                                  arise. In this way it will be possible to assess the impact in terms of price indices,
                                  linked to each solution found by the model, under the assumption that there is no
                                  influence of the mechanisms of balance between supply and demand.

                                One of WTMBT uses is to explore the implications of different future policies.
                                  There are a number of types of policies that can be easily modelled in GCAM:
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                  <b>Emissions-related policies</b>
                                  Through this model it is possible to model emission constraints as a maximum level of
                                  emissions for a given group of regions and sectors (e.g. Emission Trading System) or
                                  by imposing an emission cost level (e.g. Carbon Tax). These two different types of
                                  constraints will disrupt minimization by either affecting external constraints or
                                  directly affecting exogenous coefficients (i.e. a tax per ton of GHG in a certain
                                  sector and/or region).
                              </p>

                                  <b>Energy production policies</b>
                                  It may be possible to include a constraint requiring the model to provide, as an
                                  aggregate or regional value, a minimum quantity of production from one or more energy
                                  sources. Through the possibility of choice, both in terms of regional production and
                                  technology used to supply electricity, the model will be able to choose different
                                  ways, moving towards the one that minimizes global costs.

                                  <b>Behavioural policies</b>
                                  In principle it is possible to assess the impact of changes in behaviour, translated
                                  as a change in consumption preferences of the final demand category of households
                                  (e.g. impact of teleworking).

                                 The WTMBT does not independently assess the impact on SDGs but it is possible to derive
                                  indicators that may partially indicate an impact on some of the dimensions of several
                                  SDGs.
