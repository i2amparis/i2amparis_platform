                              <p>PSM-EU provides instances of a power system simulation models for (parts of) EU27 plus
                                  United Kingdom, Norway, and Switzerland. PSM-EU contains data at a country basis and
                                  can be used to perform capacity expansion (i.e. building new generation and
                                  transmission infrastructure) and UCED calculations, considering power plant
                                  flexibility limitations and flexible loads. The objective function of the capacity
                                  expansion is to minimise the total net present value (NPV) of build costs, fixed
                                  operation and maintenance (FOM) costs, and variable operating and maintenance (VOM)
                                  costs, while the objective function of UCED is to minimise variable generation costs.
                                  Current instances are mostly implemented in PLEXOS, a mixed-integer linear programming
                                  (MILP) model which has been used in many studies on RES integration and system
                                  adequacy, but also in a custom-made C#-software package.</p>
                              <p>PSM-EU has been used among others to assess the system adequacy of power systems with

                                  evaluate different electricity market designs, and to identify cost-effective
                                  trajectories to reach Paris targets</p>

                                  storage technologies, and negative CO2 emission technologies. Per technology,

                                  for each country. Additionally, all patterns are adapted based on electrification of

                                  Demand options are assessed for industry, and residential and tertiary appliances.
                                  Volumes and activation times are limited depending on the application and season.

                                              variability. In most scenarios firm low-carbon capacity is above 75% of
